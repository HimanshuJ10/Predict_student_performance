## ‚ú® Project Summary

This project demonstrates a complete and practical approach to data science, with the goal of **predicting student academic performance** based on various social, family, and educational factors. Through this project, a full data pipeline has been created, covering everything from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to the construction and evaluation of a machine learning model.

This project can help educators and institutions proactively identify students at risk of underperformance, allowing for timely and effective interventions.

## üìì Description
An end-to-end data analysis and machine learning project for predicting student performance using educational and social data. The project includes data analysis, model building, and an interactive dashboard.
---

## üéØ The Problem

Student academic success is influenced by numerous factors. By analyzing data related to study habits, family status, and other behavioral characteristics, we can build a model that predicts which students might receive a low final grade. This prediction enables a proactive, preventative approach rather than a reactive one.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Architecture & Workflow

This project follows a structured and modular workflow:

1.  **Data Collection & Cleaning:**
    * The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, and cleaning and preprocessing operations (such as handling missing values and correcting data types) are performed.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * A comprehensive statistical and visual analysis is conducted to uncover hidden relationships between features and the final student grade.
    * Visualizations such as a Correlation Matrix, Histograms, and Scatter Plots are created for a better understanding of the data.

3.  **Feature Engineering & Preprocessing:**
    * Categorical features are encoded numerically to make them suitable for machine learning models.
    * The data is split into training and testing sets.

4.  **Machine Learning Model:**
    * A classification model is trained to predict the final student grade (e.g., pass or fail).
    * The model's performance is measured using appropriate evaluation metrics (such as accuracy, F1-Score, and a Confusion Matrix).

5.  **Conclusion & Insights:**
    * A summary of key findings and important insights derived from the data analysis is presented.

## üíª Technical Stack & Libraries

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Data Analysis:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`
* **Data Visualization:** `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
* **Machine Learning:** `Scikit-learn`
* **Development Environment:** `Jupyter Notebook`

## üèôÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset includes features like:
- **Demographic**: `sex`, `age`, `address`, `famsize`
- **Family and Education**: `medu`, `fedu`, `mjob`, `fjob`
- **Lifestyle and Social**: `famrel`, `freetime`, `goout`, `dalc`, `walc`, `health`
- **Academic**: `absences`, `g1`, `g2`, and the target `g3`


---
## ‚úã Approach

- **Regression**  
  - Predict `g3` as a numerical value (range: 0‚Äì20).
- **Classification**  
  - Convert `g3` into two classes:  
    - **Fail**: 0‚Äì9  
    - **Pass**: 10‚Äì20
